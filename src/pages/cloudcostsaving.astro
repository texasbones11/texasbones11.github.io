// Hero Section - Value Proposition
const name = "Cloud Cost Control Without Compromise";
const tagline = `30% AWS Savings While Improving Reliability`;
const description = `When our growing cloud bill threatened to impact the bottom line, I engineered a solution 
that reduced costs by 30% while making our infrastructure more resilient - a win-win for engineering and finance.`;

// Challenge Section - Pain Points
const challenge = `The Cost Problem We Faced`;
const challengepart1 = `Wasted spend: Servers were consistently underutilized (often below 15% capacity)`;
const challengepart2 = `Expensive development environments using premium production-grade resources`;
const challengepart3 = `Paying for peak capacity around the clock, even during low-traffic periods`;

// Solution Section - Technical Approach
const solution = `How We Solved It`;
const solutionpart1 = `Consolidated services into Kubernetes, increasing server utilization to over
80% without performance impact`;
const solutionpart2 = `Right-sized environments: Used cost-appropriate instances for development/testing, 
reserving premium capacity for production`;
const solutionpart3 = `Implemented intelligent autoscaling so infrastructure costs automatically align 
with actual usage patterns`;
